@theme @theme_snap
Feature: When the moodle theme is set to Snap, teachers can upload files as resources directly to the current
  course section from a simple file input element in either read or edit mode.

  Background:
    Given the following config values are set as admin:
      | theme | snap |
    And the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | category | format |
      | Course 1 | C1 | 0 | topics |
    And the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email |
      | teacher1 | Teacher | 1 | teacher1@example.com |
      | student1 | Student | 1 | student1@example.com |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user | course | role |
      | admin | C1 | editingteacher |
      | teacher1 | C1 | editingteacher |
      | student1 | C1 | student |

  @javascript
  Scenario: In read mode, teacher uploads file.
    Given I log in with snap as "teacher1"
    And I follow "Menu"
    And I follow "Course"
    And I wait until the page is ready
    And I follow "Topic 1"
    Then "#section-1" "css_element" should exist
    And "#snap-drop-file-1" "css_element" should exist
    And I upload file "test_text_file.txt" using input "#snap-drop-file-1"
    And I upload file "test_mp3_file.mp3" using input "#snap-drop-file-1"
    Then ".snap-resource[data-type='text']" "css_element" should exist
    And ".snap-resource[data-type='mp3']" "css_element" should exist

  @javascript
  Scenario: Student cannot upload file.
    Given I log in with snap as "student1"
    And I follow "Menu"
    And I follow "Course"
    And I wait until the page is ready
    And I follow "Topic 1"
    Then "#snap-drop-file" "css_element" should not exist
